This directory should contain datasets listed in [constants.py](../src/constants.py).

Currently only one dataset supported - ISLD dataset from [paper "ActionXPose: A Novel 2D Multi-view Pose-based Algorithm for Real-time Human Action Recognition"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.12126v1.pdf).
You can download it here: [ISLD.tar.gz](https://github.com/metra4ok/MLSTM-FCN-Pytorch/files/6361118/ISLD.tar.gz).
